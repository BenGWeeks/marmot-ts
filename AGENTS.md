# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

marmot-ts is an ESM TypeScript library for Marmot (MLS over Nostr).

- `src/core/`: protocol and crypto; no I/O.
- `src/engine/`: transport-independent group state machine.
- `src/client/`: Nostr networking, storage, and client APIs.
- `src/audit/`, `src/extra/`, `src/utils/`: audit logging, optional stores, and utilities.
- `ts-mls/`: MLS fork, vendored into `dist/` during builds.
- `docs/`, `examples/`: VitePress documentation and sample apps.

Public entrypoints are defined in `package.json` exports. Keep dependencies flowing `utils → core → engine → client`; fully drain `ingest()` generators before another batch.

## Development Commands

Use pnpm 10 and Node.js 20+.

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: install dependencies.
- `pnpm build`: clean, build the MLS fork, compile, and vendor.
- `pnpm compile`: focused library compilation.
- `pnpm vitest run`: run tests once; `pnpm test` starts watch mode.
- `pnpm format` / `pnpm lint`: Prettier formatting/checking.
- `pnpm docs:dev` / `pnpm docs:build`: serve/build docs and API reference.
- After building, `bash scripts/package-smoke/run.sh`: test the packed package.

## Coding and Testing

Use two-space indentation, kebab-case filenames, camelCase functions, PascalCase types, and named exports. NodeNext relative imports require `.js` extensions. Strict TypeScript rejects unused declarations and missing returns.

Use `Uint8Array`, not `Buffer`; preserve Node, Bun, and Deno compatibility. Import the fork through bare `ts-mls`; its imports must have declared dependencies or peers.

Vitest discovers `src/**/*.test.ts`. Colocate tests in `__tests__/`; reuse `src/__tests__/helpers` and mock networking. Run a focused test with `pnpm vitest run src/path/file.test.ts`.

## Protocol References

At every phase start, fetch `origin` in both `refs/marmot` and `refs/mdk`; inspect `HEAD..origin/HEAD`, review relevant diffs, fast-forward, and commit pointer updates separately as `chore(refs):`.

Check MDK before implementing convergence, recovery, or wire encoding; record deviations. Cite topic-based spec paths; MIP numbering is deprecated.

## Contributions and Agent Workflow

Branch before committing; never commit on `master`. Use focused conventional commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) after relevant checks pass. PRs should explain behavior, link related issues, and report validation.

Add new docs pages to `.vitepress/config.ts`. Use `.agents/skills/applesauce/` for Nostr work and `.agents/skills/opentui/` for terminal UIs.

Before edits, start `/gsd-quick`, `/gsd-debug`, or `/gsd-execute-phase`, unless explicitly bypassed by the user.
